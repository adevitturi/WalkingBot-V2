## Leg assembly

The robot uses 8 legs distributed in pairs. Each pair consists of a leg and its mirrored version. So in total, the robot requires a set of 4 legs and 4 mirrored legs.

The following table describes the parts required to assembe a single leg. These parts can be found under [parts/STL/leg](parts/STL/leg).

|Parts              | Quantity | 
|-------------------|----------|
| base-bone         |    1     |
| bone0             |    1     |
| bone1             |    1     |
| bone2             |    1     |
| bone3             |    1     |
| bone4             |    1     |
| bone5             |    1     |
| bone6             |    1     |
| bone7             |    1 	   |
| toe1              |    1 	   |
| toe2              |    1 	   |

To assemle a single mirrored leg, the files are the same, but have the suffix `_MIR`. These parts can be found under [parts/STL/leg_mirrored](parts/STL/leg_mirrored).

To assemble the different sections of each leg, you can use a piece of filament and a soldering iron (or a lighter) to melt the sides of the filament. You can see an example [here][1].

First, join base-bone with bone6 and bone7.

Then add bone1 and bone 2 to the other side of base-bone.

Then join bone4 with bone1 and proceed to attach bone3 to bone1 and bone2.

Next join bone4 and bone7 with bone5.

Now join bone5 and base-bone with bone0.

Finally, attach toe1 (the longer one) to bone4 and toe2 (the short one) to bone3.
