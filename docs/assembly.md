## Leg assembly

The robot uses 8 legs distributed in pairs. Each pair consists of a leg and its mirrored version. So in total, the robot requires a set of 4 legs and 4 mirrored legs.

The following table describes the parts required to assembe a single leg. These parts can be found under [parts/STL/leg](parts/STL/leg).

|Parts              | Quantity | 
|-------------------|----------|
| base-bone         |    1     |
| bone0             |    1     |
| bone1             |    1     |
| bone2             |    1     |
| bone3             |    1     |
| bone4             |    1     |
| bone5             |    1     |
| bone6             |    1     |
| bone7             |    1 	   |
| toe1              |    1 	   |
| toe2              |    1 	   |

To assemle a single mirrored leg, the files are the same, but have the suffix `_MIR`. These parts can be found under [parts/STL/leg_mirrored](parts/STL/leg_mirrored).

To assemble the different sections of each leg, you can use a piece of filament and a soldering iron (or any other hot material) to melt the sides of the filament.
